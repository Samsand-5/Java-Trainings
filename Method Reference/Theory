A Method Reference is a shortcut for writing lambda expressions that just call a method.

Syntax:
ClassName::methodName

Itâ€™s basically saying:
"Instead of writing a lambda that just calls a method, just reference the method directly."

Why Use Method References?
ðŸ”¹ Cleaner and shorter syntax
ðŸ”¹ Improves readability
ðŸ”¹ Works with functional interfaces

Types of Method References

of a particular object				object::instanceMethod				System.out::println

an arbitrary object of a particular type	ClassName::instanceMethod			String::toLowerCase
